# Float, Position, and Shapes

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use different CSS positioning techniques such as `fixed`, `relative`, and `absolute`. It also includes an example of using the float property with clearing techniques, along with creating overlapping colored circular shapes using CSS.

The webpage includes:

- A fixed-position green box that stays visible while scrolling.
- A relative container with an absolutely positioned element inside.
- A section demonstrating a floated image with properly cleared text.
- A figure composed of overlapping colored circles using absolute positioning and z-index.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Features

- **Fixed Positioning:** The green box remains fixed on the screen during scrolling.
- **Relative & Absolute Positioning:** Elements positioned relative to their container.
